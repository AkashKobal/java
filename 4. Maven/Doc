Maven:Project Management Tool

How Maven works?
Once you add dependency, maven will search this dependency in the local machine,
i,e in .m2 hidden folder, if it is found in the local machine (.m2) folder than it will use that dependency,
if it is not found in the local machine, then it will search in the remote repository (central repository),
if it is found in the remote repository, then it will download that dependency and use it, if it is not found
in the remote repository, then it will throw an error.


Libraries in java are called JAR Files.

Maven helps to compile, run, test, packaging, and deploy
Java applications, maven alone will manage this.

Maven is a build automation tool used primarily for Java projects.

Apache Maven is a powerful project management tool that is based on POM (project object model).
It is used for project builds, dependency management, and documentation.
It simplifies the build process like ANT(Ant is a Java library and command line tool whose can
be used to compile your code, fetching dependencies and for packaging).
But it is much more advanced than ANT. In short terms, Maven is a tool that can be used for building
and managing any Java-based project. Maven makes the day-to-day work of Java developers easier
and generally helps with the overall comprehension of any Java-based project.
